<p>
Based in Essex, I am a copy writer and proof reader with a keen eye for detail, unwavering focus and the inability to take anything for granted. 
<br><br>
I don&#39t just proof read a document: I interrogates it. Armed only with a red pen, a dictionary and the absolute conviction that whatever I proof read, no matter how professionally produced, must contain at least one error, I contribute to the safeguarding of corporate, professional and personal reputations one word at a time. 
<br><br>
I am just as at home working in-house as part of a publications or document-preparation team as I am working remotely, using whatever software or electronic methodology my client is most comfortable with. However you wish to work, I&#39m only too happy to accommodate.
<br><br>
&#39Never assume&#39 is my motto. Anything that appears even slightly suspect will be comprehensively investigated. You&#39re as likely to see me with a telephone in his hand, eliminating queries, as you are to see me grasping a red pen, poring over a printed page. 
<br><br>
Although I am thorough by nature, I fully appreciates the hectic and demanding pace of the commercial world. I work swiftly and decisively, prioritising my workload to reflect my client&#39s requirements. Neither pig headed nor pedantic, I recognise the necessity for intelligent and judicious compromise when deadlines loom and budgets demand.

Her turn-around time is always punctual and she works quickly but accurately.

We would certainly recommend her.
